## Guidelines of contribution

## What makes a good exercise or solution
As far as I'm concerned, I don't think there's a perfect answer to this question, but here's my approach to what makes a good exercise or solution to be added to the project

* <b>A given exercise (A problem or algorithm to be solved) does not exist in the project.</b> It should be relatively unique in comparison to the already existing exercises. You shouldn't try to reinvent the wheel when looking for an exercise to solve.

* <b>A given exercise is self-contained.</b> Exercise itself should be treated as isolated problem or an algorithm that is to be solved, but not multiple exercises stacked into one. Now, to be clear - that does not mean that a problem can't have layers, or multiple steps of logic that are required for a solution, however an exercise should have a clear and concise objective, and should not be an open-ended question or a vague description that is to be interpreted.

* <b>A given solution is unique enough in comparison to the existing solutions to that exercise.</b> Feel free to reuse parts of existing solutions to a given exercise, but don't be afraid to utilize different tools and functionalities that the C# .NET Framework provides you with right out of the box. A solution should be inherently a different approach to the problem, which means re-writing an existing solution, but with a loop that simply goes backwards, isn't an alternative solution and a good addition to the project.

## Code conventions
In order for the project to remain well-built and structured you should align with stylistic of the code in the repo already. Good place to start would be following [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).

## Issues
I'd consider [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) as a standardized and widely accepted way of contributing to the project and its contents. It covers everything from feature requests, bugs, suggestions to questions. If you wish to read further, GitHub documentation on [Creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) has got you covered. As a general rule of thumb, here's a few bulletpoints I'd like you to follow, when creating an issues, regardless of its type:
* Title of the issues should be clear, concise and descriptive.
* Utilize existing [labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) for your issues to be more informative. If you believe an additional label should be created - create an issue with a default label 'enhancement', where you'd explain what label and why should be added to the project.
* Provide an informative, comprehensive description of the bug, suggested feature or an enhancement that you believe should be changed/added or improved in the project.
* If possible, feel free to provide pictures, flowcharts or any other forms of visual representation of the suggestion or a problem. Make it easy for others to understand you, and get on the same page.

## How to contribute
1. Clone the repository and make a new branch. [README.md Getting started](README.md) section might be a good starting point.
2. Make any and all changes to your branch. Whatever that might be - a bugfix, a new exercise, a new solution or a documentation change.
3. Do NOT clump together multiple things into the same branch - a single branch should cover a single thing (I.e. A single solution, or two solution to the SAME exercise, some changes to documentation, refactoring a single class or function).
4. Make sure your project builds and passes all the tests.
5. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) Will understandable, short and simple description of changes.
